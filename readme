Parameters:

notifier_params.py
*	notifierType = "visual" | "file"
*	nstepsPlot = 1 

*	projections = {"dim0": [0.5 * (zf_0 + z0_0), False], "dim1": [0.5 * (zf_1 + z0_1), False], "color": True}
plot projections on dim 0 at point z0 = 0.5 * (zf_0 + z0_0)  , does not calculate maximum velocity on this projetcion
plot projections on dim 0 at point z1 = 0.5 * (zf_1 + z0_1) ,  calculates maximum velocity on this projetcion and put it on legend
plot colormap
*	plotAnalitical = True | False  - set it to True in order to plot analytical solution: take care this is only defined in few cases: see initcond_soundwave



constants.py
For first generation scheme set bcStep = "interm" | "final" to specify in which step to apply the boundary conditions


sound_wave_params.py

*	rho00 

*	mediumType = "homog"
	mediumType = "inhomog"  #variable density rho00 to test with wave packet
		rho01 = 0.01
		ze = 
		we 
		densFunc 

*	p00 
*	v00 
*	A 

*	periodicType = "repeat" #used for moving plane
	periodicType = "refl" #use it with wave packet - reflection constant deriv for pres and rho, vel = 0
	periodicType = "diff" #tried to use it with hankel - constant deriv for vel , pres and rho
Boundary conditions to apply see initcond_soundwave
*	wType = "all"
	wType = "pot"
if w defined here is a function such that rho0, pres0 and vel0 = constant * w(z) set it to "all"
if w defined here is the velocity potential set it to "pot"

*	timesZArgW = 1 #1(sine, gauss) or 2(wave packet)
(how many times z is argument in w)

FOR timesZArgW == 1:
	*	functionType = "sine" | "gauss" | "hankell"
	* argType = "x" | "y" | "r" | "d1"
